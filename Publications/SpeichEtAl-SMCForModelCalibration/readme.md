This folder documents the scripts used to generate the simulations described in the manuscript “Sequential Monte-Carlo algorithms for Bayesian model calibration – a review and method comparison” by M. Speich, C.F. Dormann and F. Hartig on July 1, 2019, currently submitted to Methods in Ecology and Evolution.

1.	Scripts to generate reference MCMC data
For each dynamical model, a reference sampler was generated by applying the MCMC-DEZS algorithm with a large number of iterations (see Table 1 of the manuscript). This sampler represents the benchmark against which the MCMC and SMC runs were compared, i.e. quality of these samplers was assessed as the distance (see Eq. 5 in the manuscript) to this reference. VSEM a and b refer to the versions with and without strong correlation, respectively. Regarding 3-PGN, as the only difference between 3-PGN and 3-PGNsleep is an artificial increase of runtime, the same reference sampler could be used for these two cases. The output of this script is written to a file, which is loaded by the MCMC and SMC benchmarking scripts.

2.	Scripts to benchmark MCMC algorithm
Depending on the model, it was sometimes faster to use the DEZS algorithm with or without parallelization (see Table 1). The version provided here is the version that was used in the study, i.e. the faster one. These scripts take one argument, to be supplied via command line. This argument is a number, which was used here to differentiate between the five instances of the script that were run. The random seed is also set on this number, to guarantee that the five runs are different from each other, but reproducible.

3.	Scripts to benchmark SMC algorithm
Analogously to the MCMC benchmark scripts, the SMC scripts were executed five times, so that they also take a number as command line argument. For the multivariate normal case, the reference, MCMC and SMC benchmarks are all generated in the same file.

4.	Scripts for parallelization benchmark
This folder contains the files used for the benchmark of SMC under different parallelization options. The files for the runs on a single core take only one command-line argument (run number, as above), whereas the files for 2 or more cores also take the number of cores as an additional command-line argument.

5.	Launch scripts
This file provides examples of files used to launch our scripts on the NEMO cluster, using the MOAB scheduling system. They cannot be executed on a cluster with a different scheduler, but provide some guidance on how to specify the command-line arguments.
